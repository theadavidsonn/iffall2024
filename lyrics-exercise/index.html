                <p>When you do your best, hell, that's all you can do</p>

                <p>[Verse 1: SZA]</p>
                <p>I'm runnin' away from where I'm from</p>
                <p>Never can stay with no one</p>
                <p>Lovin' you almost feels like somethin'</p>
                <p>When no one's around me</p>
                <p>You lost and found me</p>
                <p>I was surrounded</p>

                <p>[Verse 2: SZA]</p>
                <p>Spent your life bein' hopeless</p>

                <p>I know, oh, this is bad</p>
                <p>But, please, put a leash on me anyway</p>
                <p>Who needs self-esteem anyway?</p>
                <p>I hate myself to make you stay</p>
