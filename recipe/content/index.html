            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Butternut Squah Lasagna is something my family has eaten for Christmas and News Years dinner every year. It is a pretty simple dish that follows the same steps as a traditional lasagna with different ingredients. We don't have one recipe we use for it and often switch it up every year but I thought I would share one of the recipes we have used in the past!</p>

                <p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
                <p>1 butternut squah, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes</p>
                <p>salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
                <p>1/2 cup water</p>
                <p>3 amaretti cookies, crumbled</p>
                <p>1/4 cup butter</p>
                <p>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</p>
                <p>3 1/2 cups whole milk</p>
                <p>Pinch of nutmeg</p>
                <p>3/4 cup (lightly packed) fresh basil leaves</p>
                <p>12 no-boil lasagna noodles</p>
                <p>1 1/2 cups shredded whole-milk mozzerella cheese</p>
                <p>1/3 cup grated Parmesan</p>
            <h1>Instructions</h1>
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the squash and toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the water into the skillet and then cover and simmer over medium heat until the squash is tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly and then transfer the squash to a food processor. Add the amaretti cookies and blend until smooth. Season the squash puree, to taste, with more salt and pepper.</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> Melt the butter in a heavy medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, whisking often, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the nutmeg. Cool slightly. Transfer half of the sauce to a blender*. Add the basil and blend until smooth. Return the basil sauce to the sauce in the pan and stir to blend. Season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste.</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> Lightly butter a 13 by 9 by 2-inch glass baking dish. Spread 3/4 cup of the sauce over the prepared baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles on the bottom of the pan. Spread 1/3 of the squash puree over the noodles. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese. Drizzle 1/2 cup of sauce over the noodles. Repeat layering 3 more times.</p>
                <p><strong>5.</strong> Tightly cover the baking dish with foil and bake the lasagna for 40 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses over the lasagna. Continue baking uncovered until the sauce bubbles and the top is golden, 15 minutes longer. Let the lasagna stand for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
                <p><strong>6.</strong> *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.</p>

            <h1>Recipe Websites</h1>
                <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1505788/recipes">Martha Stewart</a>  
                    <p>I chose this website because I thought it was super easy to navigate and organised smoothly. Each recipe has been labeled and organised in different sections that makes it very easy to both find what you are looking for, and explore new options. </p>
                <a href="https://www.deliciouslyella.com/en-us/">Deliciously Ella</a>
                    <p>I like the Delisciously Ella because I her visuals are very beautiful, and each page of the site has a wide variety of imagery and recipies to try. Also, I appreciate when a plant-based recipe website looks more visually appealing because it can make these often overlooked options more enticing, encouraging more people to explore plant-based meals. </p> 
                <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com">Smitten Kitten</a>
                    <p>I chose the Smitten Kitchen they have a well designed website that I can scroll through and explore recipies with a lot of ease. However the feature that stood out to me the most and ultimately why I picked this site is their "Suprise Me!" feature. When you press on this button the website automatically gives you a random recipe of theirs to try out, and you can continue to click it to get different options. I think this adds a nice fun element to the website and if someone does not know what they want to make, they can experiment with this function to help guide them instead of overwhelm. </p>

            <h1>Non-recipe Websites</h1>
                <a href="https://pizzana.com">Pizzana</a>
                    <p>Pizzana is a restaurant that I eat at a lot when I am home and I have always admired their website. I think their hero scrolling bar at the top is a really nice touch on a website, as well as the color pallette they have chosen. As a whole, I think the site is visually pleasing and does a good job at matching the visuals of the restuarant.</p>
                <a href="https://montysgoodburger.com">Monty's Good Burger</a>
                    <p>Monty's Good Burger is a plant based burger restuarant that I also chose to eat at often when I am home from school. The thing that stood out to me the most was the impressive and cohesive illustrations. As you scroll down the page, the visuals are easy to understand, and the way they have designed their menus and icons have created a very strong through-line across the platform.</p>
                <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>
                    <p>I chose Shopify as another website because not only is the company a great idea that helps many people, but they also have great communication design. All the information about getting started and the pricing of their packages are explained clearly, it is easy to navigate, and each visual aspect is meticulously chosen out. </p>
