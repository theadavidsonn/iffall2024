       <h1>Intro Questions</h1> 
        <p>1. My name is Thea Davidson, I am majoring in Communication Design and I am currently a junior.</p>
        <p>2. Since I am a Communication Design major this is one of my required classes to take, but I have always been curious about HTML and have thought its a great skill to know and understand. </p>
        <p>3. I don't have any prior histpry with HTML/CSS/JS but I am excited to learn more!</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn to be confident with this material and gain a stron understanding of how it works</p>
        <p>5. I think something that will be different for designing to screen than designing for paper is that I feel designing for a screen can sometimes be much more conceptual. When designing for paper, visuals are very clear and theres a strong understanding of what is going on, where are designing for screen requires a stronger imagination of how something will be visually understood.</p>
        <p>6. https://www.moma.org I chose MOMA as a website that I believe showcases effective design because I think the color and word relationships work very well, it understands visual/conceptual look that MOMA has, and is overall very clean and organised. </p>
        <p>7. https://www.netflix.com I think that netflix exemplifies effective communication because the site is very user friendly and simple to understand, while staying consistent with where to find information on each show, your subsription, etc. </p>
        <p>8. https://spotify.com I chose spotify as a website that works well because I think overall they have been able to really understand their audience and provide them with a site that caters to exactly that. The site has a large user count and caters to each persons music taste while still providing new music options specifically catered to each person. In addition, I believe their "connect with friends" feature to stand out because it provides a sense of community to the website and further inpsires use. They have completed many successful feats while still maintaining a cohesive visual read and user experience that is very friendly.</p>
